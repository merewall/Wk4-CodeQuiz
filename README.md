# Wk4-CodeQuiz
Building a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions from scratch.
## Description
This project was completed after learning JavaScript and Web APIs. The task was to create an online multiple choice quiz about coding concepts. The quiz is meant to use the concepts of DOM traversal, setting attributes, event listeners, timers, intervals, local storage, and dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The following acceptance criteria were used in the development of this web application:

* When the user clicks the start button, a timer starts and the user is presented with a question.
* When the user answers a question, the user is presented with the next question.
* When the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
* When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over
* When the quiz is over, the user can enter and save their initials and score to the page

## Mock-Up
